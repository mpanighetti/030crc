## Compatibility

This content was written to be compatible with Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition. It makes the following modifications from the _Systems Reference Document_:

- "Species" is used in place of "race" and "ancestry" or "variant" in place of "subrace".
- This document uses new traits called **Condition Resistance** and **Condition Vulnerability**. Resistance to a condition means that a creature has Advantage on Saving Throws made to resist that condition, and vulnerability to a condition means that a creature has Disadvantage on such Saving Throws.
- Damage and condition resistance, vulnerability, and immunity are now grouped together as **Resistances**, **Vulnerabilities**, and **Immunities** respectively.
- Resistance, vulnerability, and immunity to Poison apply to both the damage type and the Poisoned condition.
