# October 1st (Challenge 0)

Prompt: **Trick-or-Treat**

### [Trickered Treat](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-monsters/blob/main/constructs/trickered-treat.md)

#### Lore

A creation of hags tired of Feywild children demanding sweets at all hours of the night, trickered treats are animated candies designed to look as inviting and appetizing as possible, so that they might tempt would-be victims into having a taste. Such temptations are short-lived, as the candies will immediately assail anyone interacting with them, taking careful aim at the creature's mouth and pummeling their teeth until they retreat. The treats are theoretically edible, but are coated with a putrefying concoction that will cause the most steel-hearted consumer's stomach to lurch violently.

_**Constructed Nature.**_ Trickered treats do not require air, food, drink, or sleep.

_**Sugar Rush.**_ Even though trickered treats are toxic to consume, they can still confer useful benefits to anyone who can stomach them. A Small or larger creature may swallow a Grappled, Restrained, or Incapacitated trickered treat. Doing so instantly destroys the treat, and the creature must make a DC 15 Constitution Saving Throw. On a failed Saving Throw, the creature is Poisoned for 1 hour, and cannot regain Hit Points while Poisoned in this manner. On a successful save, the creature gains the effects of the _haste_ spell for 1 minute (no Concentration required).

# October 2nd (Challenge 1)

Prompt: **Capitalism**

### [Avatar of Debt](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-monsters/blob/main/undead/avatar-of-debt.md)

#### Lore

> 'Tis impossible to be sure of any thing but Death and Taxes.

â€” _The Cobbler of Preston_

On worlds where coinage and wealth dictate one's societal worth and position of power, taxes can be the great equalizer. Monarchs and paupers alike have fallen to the mighty tax collector, and so too do the mightiest adventurers eventually have to account for the mountains of wealth accrued during their escapades. For a very unlucky few, this rebalancing comes in the form of an audit from an avatar of debt.

Though the scythe of this grim spectre looks intimidating, it draws neither blood nor vitality. It instead cuts directly into the purse of whoever sits on the receiving end, reducing one's wealth with every blow. This taxman will not relent until one's entire balance is withdrawn, insisting that "the debt must be paid".

Any taxes the avatar collects are stowed away in a pocket dimension only they can access. If the avatar is reduced to 0 Hit Points, their pocket dimension collapses and their collected taxes appear on the ground where they previously stood.

##### Summoning an Avatar of Debt

The Dungeon Master may opt to replace the Ruin card from a _Deck of Many Things_ with the Audit card, which behaves as follows when drawn:

_**Audit.**_ You summon an avatar of debt â€“ a ghostly skeleton creature clad in a snappy business suit and burgundy tie, and carrying a spectral scythe. They appear in a space of the Dungeon Master's choice within 10 feet of you and attack you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights you until you have no more wealth or they drop to 0 Hit Points, whereupon they disappear. If anyone besides you tries to attack the avatar, they summon their own avatar of debt. A creature whose wealth is reduced to 0 by an avatar of debt can't possess coinage for 3d10 days, during which time any coins they attempt to obtain disappear into the avatar's pocket dimension.

  <figcaption>Avatar of Debt by <a href="https://linktr.ee/RedDrawnArt">RedDrawn Art</a></figcaption>
</figure>

#### Attributes

_Medium undead, lawful evil_

- **Armor Class** 13
- **Hit Points** half the Hit Point Maximum of their summoner
- **Speed** 60 ft., fly 60 ft. (hover)

|  STR  |  DEX  |  CON  |  INT  |  WIS  | CHA  |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:----:|
|14 (+2)|17 (+3)|16 (+3)|20 (+5)|18 (+4)|4 (-3)|

- **Immunities** Charmed, Frightened, Necrotic, Paralyzed, Petrified, Poison, Unconscious
- **Senses** Darkvision 60 ft., Truesight 60 ft., passive Perception 14
- **Languages** all languages known of their summoner
- **Challenge** equal to the summoner's level or challenge rating, minimum 1 (200 XP)[^ðŸ’€]

[^ðŸ’€]: Technically, the avatar of debt breaks D&D's challenge rating system; in addition to their scaling Hit Point Maximum (similar to the avatar of death), the avatar cannot deal damage, and thus on its face presents no challenge beyond time spent. But the impact on wealth could be devastating to some players or campaigns, regardless of level. For the purpose of this project, we'll call the avatar a CR1, as a 1st level character should be able to defeat it, and in any case won't die even if the avatar wins the encounter.

#### Special Traits

_**Ledger Domain.**_ If the creature that summoned the avatar has no wealth in physical coinage, the avatar immediately teleports to their pocket dimension and cannot be summoned again by that creature for one year.

_**Desk Work.**_ The avatar is incapable of dealing damage to a creature.

_**Incorporeal Movement.**_ The avatar can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. They take 5 (1d10) Force damage if they end their turn inside an object.

_**Turning Immunity.**_ The avatar is immune to features that turn undead.

#### Actions

_**Taxes.**_ The avatar sweeps their spectral scythe through a creature within 5 feet of them. Roll a number of d12s equal to half the summoner's level or challenge rating (round down, minimum 1). A number of random coins equal to the dice roll immediately disappears from the target's wealth and reappears in the avatar's pocket dimension, and the avatar regains a number of Hit Points equal to the number of coins they take.

The tax is collected even if the creature's wealth is not under their current physical possession; the coins will be removed from any chest, bank, loan to another creature, extradimensional space, or any other location or plane, as long as the wealth exists as physical coinage.

# October 3rd (Challenge 2)

Prompt: **Misunderstood Monster**

### [Werechimp](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-monsters/blob/main/humanoids/werechimp.md)

#### Lore

Perhaps the least studied of lycanthropes, troganthropes tend to form tight-knit bands far away from human settlements to avoid persecution. Their societies are often found in dense jungles or tropical islands to help maintain their distance from society, and their interactions with humans are rare, often limited to the occasional wandering explorer or unfortunate shipwreck.

Asinius Avitus Scipio, self-proclaimed first-hand expert on this subject, has published multiple volumes full of spurious assertions about werechimps. In _"Writing with One Arm: Tips for Limb-Lacking Mages and Interesting Applications of Mage Hand"_, he makes offhanded claims that werechimps have a prediliction toward severing and consuming the arms of humanoids they encounter, but the medical record has scant examples to offer in his support. By any reputable accounts, werechimps can be sociable people, though they prefer to keep to themselves. Most instances of troganthropic curses are accidental or provoked by human aggressors.

_**Characters as Werechimps.**_ The _Monster Manual_ has rules for characters afflicted with lycanthropy. The following text applies to werechimp characters specifically:

A character cursed with werechimp lycanthropy gains a Strength of 16 if their score isn't already higher. Attack and damage rolls for the werechimp's bite are based on whichever is higher of the character's Strength and Dexterity.

#### Attributes

- **Armor Class** 12
- **Hit Points** 39 (6d8 + 12)
- **Speed** 30 ft. in humanoid form; 30 ft., climb 30 ft. in chimp and hybrid form

|  STR  |  DEX  |  CON  |  INT  |  WIS  |  CHA  |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
|16 (+3)|15 (+2)|15 (+2)|12 (+1)|15 (+2)|14 (+2)|

- **Skills** Athletics +5, Intimidation +4, Perception +4
- **Senses** passive Perception 14
- **Languages** Common (can't speak in chimp form)
- **Challenge** 2 (450 XP) **Proficiency Bonus** +2

#### Special Traits

_**Pack Tactics.**_ The werechimp has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the werechimp's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

#### Actions

_**Multiattack (Human or Hybrid Form Only).**_ The werechimp makes up to two attacks, only one of which can be a bite.

_**Bite (Chimp or Hybrid Form Only).**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 5 (1d4 + 3) Piercing damage. If the target is a humanoid, they must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution Saving Throw or be cursed with werechimp lycanthropy.

_**Fist.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d6 + 3) Bludgeoning damage.

_**Stone Dagger.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 8 (2d4 + 3) Piercing damage.

_**Change Shape.**_ The werechimp polymorphs into a chimpâ€“humanoid hybrid or into a chimp, or back into their true form, which is humanoid. Their statistics, other than their speed, are the same in each form. Any equipment they are wearing or carrying isn't transformed. They revert to their humanoid form if they die.

# October 14th (Challenge 13)

Prompt: **Forest**

## Creatures of the Murexian Grove

The peaks of the Ashen Scape loom large on the horizon, towering over the plains to the west and separating them from the seas. This mountain range was formed from now-dormant volcanoes as the continent drifted across shifting plates deep beneath the ocean. Though these mountains no longer rain down fiery death upon the lands, the soil was infused with vast deposits of a material known as murex, which gives the neighboring forest both its name and its purplish hue.

### Anatomy of a Murexian Creature

Murex exists at all levels of the food chain in the Grove, permeating from the soil to the plants to the herbivores and carnivores, then back into the soil and carrion feeders. Though murex is highly toxic when creatures are exposed to it directly, the denizens of the forest adapt to the murex and incorporate it into their bodies. In addition to the bright purple stripes, spots, rings, and other markings, the murex can cause more extreme mutations. Creatures corrupted by murex will become venomous, injecting deadly toxins into any prey that hasn't adapted to endure the effect.

On occasion, these mutations extend to new physiological features such as back and tail frills or bioluminescence. The intensity of the physical mutations increases with higher levels of corruption.

A plant or animal newly introduced to the Murexian Grove, if not killed and eaten by the deadly venomous predators there, will start to mutate after subsisting on a murexian diet for about one month. Most of the physical changes will last until the creature dies or is removed from the Grove for more than 1d4 days. Constructs and undead, as well as creatures that are already immune to Poison, are immune to murexian corruption.

### Murexian Corruption Levels

Murexian creatures have varying traits due to the severity of corruption caused by the murex in their systems. The following traits apply to all murexian creatures of given challenge rating thresholds; lower corruption traits also apply to creatures with more severe corruption, unless otherwise noted. In addition, creatures corrupted by murex gain the monstrosity type in addition to their current types.

#### Partial Corruption (Challenge 1 or lower)

_**Murexian Immunity.**_ The creature is immune to Poison, including murexian Poison.

_**Poisonous Skin.**_ If another creature comes into direct contact with a murexian creature's body, they must succeed on a DC 9 Constitution Saving Throw or become Poisoned for 1 minute. A Poisoned creature no longer in direct contact with the murexian creature can repeat the Saving Throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on themself on a success.

Additionally, if a creature eats a murexian plant or animal, they must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution Saving Throw or become Poisoned for 1 hour.

#### Severe Corruption (Challenge 2-5)

_**Enhanced Poisonous Skin.**_ The DC on the Poisonous Skin trait's Saving Throw is now increased to the recommended level for the creature's challenge rating (after murexian corruption modifications). For example, a creature with challenge 2 has a recommended save DC of 13, and a creature with challenge 8 increases the save DC to 16. See the Dungeon Master's Workshop chapter in the _Dungeon Master's Guide_ for reference.

Additionally, a creature that fails this Saving Throw is paralyzed until the end of their next turn.

_**Murexian Poison.**_ All attacks and traits of a murexian creature that deal Poison damage or conditions treat Poison immunity as Poison resistance and ignores a target's normal Poison resistance, unless the target has specific resistances or immunities to murexian Poisons. Targets with Poison immunity or murexian Poison resistance have Advantage on Saving Throws against murexian Poison, and targets with murexian Poison immunity automatically succeed on such Saving Throws.

_**Toxic Injection.**_ The sludge coursing through the veins and fangs of murexian creatures is highly toxic to those who come in contact with them. When a murexian creature hits a creature with an attack using a natural weapon (e.g. a Bite or Claws attack), the attack deals an additional 1d6 murexian Poison damage.

#### Complete Corruption (Challenge 6 or higher)

_**Toxic Infusion.**_ The Toxic Injection trait deals an additional 3d6 murexian Poison damage on a hit with attacks using a natural weapon.

_**Venom Surge.**_ A creature that is already Poisoned by murex and fails the Poisonous Skin Saving Throw instead suffers one level of Exhaustion. A creature cannot have more than one level of Exhaustion at a time caused by the Venom Surge trait from the same murexian creature.

## Example Murexian Creatures

The following creatures are all based on existing creatures and modified with murexian traits based on their original challenge rating (the murexian squirrel is based on a rat with climbing speed and pack tactics added). This can serve as an example of how murex corruption affects a stat block. Note that the addition of Poison immunity, contact Poison effects, and increased damage on attacks can affect the challenge rating; an effort has been made to recalculate challenge ratings accordingly, and some attributes have been adjusted to better match the new challenge rating.

_**Murexian Poison.**_ All murexian Poison damage and conditions dealt by the hellwasp treat Poison immunity as Poison resistance and ignore a target's normal Poison resistance, unless the target has specific resistance or immunity to murexian Poisons. Targets with Poison immunity or murexian Poison resistance have Advantage on Saving Throws against murexian Poison, and targets with murexian Poison immunity automatically succeed on such Saving Throws.

_**Enhanced Poisonous Skin.**_ If another creature comes into direct contact with the hellwasp's body (including as part of the hellwasp's Sting or Sword Talons attacks), they must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution Saving Throw or become Poisoned with murex for 1 minute and Paralyzed until the end of their next turn. A Poisoned creature no longer in direct contact with the hellwasp can repeat the Saving Throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on themself on a success.

#### Actions

_**Multiattack.**_ The hellwasp makes two attacks: one with their sting and one with their sword talons.

_**Sting.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 8 (1d8 + 4) Piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) Fire damage and 3 (1d6) murexian Poison damage.

_**Sword Talons.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 11 (2d6 + 4) Piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) murexian Poison damage.

### [Murexian Beholder](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-monsters/blob/main/monstrosities/murexian-beholder.md)

#### Lore

It is a strange scenario indeed for a beholder to allow themself to become corrupted by murex. This might occur if the beholder was driven out of their lair and had to flee, finding themself in the Murexian Grove and subsisting on the tainted flesh of the beasts found there to survive. Or it may have been a conscious decision, some play to take in these powerful toxins to use against their real or perceived foes. The ambitions of a beholder are sometimes difficult to predict, and a beholder prefers it this way.

However this came to be, the beholder will find not only their body infused with murex, but also their mind. The toxins cloud thought and judgment, twisting the beholder's innate paranoia. The aberrant mind becomes more so, reducing the beholder's intelligence and making them fearful of anything they encounter, thinking that they have discovered an agent of their foes. Such a beholder will generally try to kill creatures on the spot rather than converse or negotiate terms. They still make an effort to anticipate their enemies' next actions, but they become a generally less effective tactician.

Murexian beholders will happily make their new surroundings into a lair, tending to create vast tunnels underground amidst the mexite deposits from ancient volcanic activity. Their slaves dig until they hit magma flows, so that the beholder might better protect their interests through ever more hazardous pathways.

#### Special Traits

_**Antimagic Cone.**_ The beholder's central eye creates an area of antimagic, as in the antimagic field spell, in a 150-foot-cone. At the start of each of their turns, the beholder decides which way the cone faces and whether the cone is active. The area works against the beholder's own eye rays.

_**Murexian Poison.**_ All murexian Poison damage and conditions dealt by the beholder treat Poison immunity as Poison resistance and ignore a target's normal Poison resistance, unless the target has specific resistance or immunity to murexian Poisons. Targets with Poison immunity or murexian Poison resistance have Advantage on Saving Throws against murexian Poison, and targets with murexian Poison immunity automatically succeed on such Saving Throws.

_**Venom Surge.**_ If another creature comes into direct contact with the beholder's body (including as part of the beholder's Bite attack), they must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution Saving Throw or become Poisoned with murex for 1 minute and Paralyzed until the end of their next turn. A Poisoned creature no longer in direct contact with the beholder can repeat the Saving Throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on themself on a success.

Additionally, a creature that is already Poisoned by murex and fails this Saving Throw instead suffers one level of Exhaustion. A creature cannot have more than one level of Exhaustion at a time caused by the Venom Surge trait from the same murexian creature.

#### Actions

_**Bite.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 14 (4d6) Piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) murexian Poison damage.

_**Eye Rays.**_ The beholder shoots three of their magical eye rays at random (re-roll duplicates), choosing one to three targets they can see within 120 feet of them. See the beholder stat block in the _Monster Manual_ for eye ray effects; the Enervation Ray is replaced with a Murexian Ray which behaves as follows:

_Murexian Ray._ The targeted creature must make a DC 18 Constitution Saving Throw. On a failed Saving Throw, the target takes 36 (8d8) murexian Poison damage and is Poisoned by murex as described in the Venom Surge trait. On a successful Saving Throw, the ray damage is halved and the target is not Poisoned by murex.

#### Legendary Actions

The beholder can take 3 Legendary Actions, using the Eye Ray option below. They can take only one Legendary Action at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The beholder regains spent Legendary Actions at the start of their turn.

**Eye Ray.** The beholder uses one random eye ray.

### [Phygius](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-monsters/blob/main/fey/phygius.md)

#### Lore

Legend speaks of a giant deer with three massive horns atop its head, which appears and disappears within a forest tangled in planar energies. It is from these scarce sightings in the distant past that the [Middlestag Forest](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-mote/blob/main/mote/esterfell/lenya/middlestag-forest.md) was given its name, but none of the local families have any more context on what the Middlestag is, where it comes from, and what it might want when it shows itself. Some have reported seeing this mighty creature appear to rapidly flicker in and out of existence, making it unclear whether what they saw was even real.

This cervid is in fact a powerful archfey named [Phygius](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-mote/blob/main/pantheon/phygius.md). It resides in the Middlestag Forest as well as its intersections with adjacent planes, seemingly jumping erratically between them. Phygius is equally within its domain whether in the forest as it manifests in [Esterfell](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-mote/blob/main/mote/esterfell/esterfell.md) or in the Feywild.

The leading theory to explain Phygius' strange interplanar nature is that it was transformed by falling [starstuff](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-mote/blob/main/artifacts/starstuff.md) millennia ago, possibly during the impact that formed Esterfell itself. Such an infusion of stellar energies could dislodge a sufficiently powerful creature from its attachment to a single plane, causing its body to physically reside in multiple adjacent planes simultaneously and periodically settle on one or another before shifting away again.

It is unclear what effect such a state of being would have on a creature's psyche, and thus far none in Esterfell have reported successfully communicating with Phygius. The courts of the Feywild respect Phygius' power and tend to leave it to its own unknowable devices.

Phygius tends to make itself visible on the Esterfell side of the forest when the barriers between planes are weakened, be it by arcanists tampering with starstuff or an impending new stellar bombardment. It is said that seeing the Middlestag on a moonlit night is a sign of strange future occurrences to come, such as the sudden appearance of frightening otherworldly creatures and the disappearance of loved ones into the Feywild.

These movements of other beings across the planes are unlikely to be Phygius' doing; rather, it seems to have the innate ability to detect openings between worlds and is drawn to them. Whether it presides over these temporary tears in reality out of approval of the blending of worlds or whether it watches over these events to try and prevent disaster is unknown, but its perceived role as a harbinger has led to fear and superstition surrounding any sightings.

Farmers and hunters in the region might revere the Stag as a minor deity, but thus far the archfey seems completely indifferent to the affairs of most mortals of Esterfell, unless they dare to tug at the edges of reality and order and move between worlds. This will draw its attention, but it is thus far unclear whether being noticed by Phygius would have a positive outcome.

#### Special Traits

_**Innate Spellcasting.**_ Phygius' innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (Spell Save DC 24). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:

- At will: _dispel magic_, _druidcraft_, _faerie fire_
- 3/day each: _bless_, _charm monster_, _conjure animals_, _greater invisibility_, _moonbeam_, _plant growth_, _spike growth_, _suggestion_, _transport via plants_
- 1/day each: _color spray_, _crown of stars_, _druid grove_, _geas_

Spells under 5th level are cast at 5th level.

_**Interplanar Nature.**_ While in the Ethereal Plane, the Feywild, or the Material Plane, Phygius is aware of the location and alignment of all creatures within 30 feet of Phygius' corresponding location on each plane. Additionally, Phygius is immune to _banishment_ or similar spells or effects when it is on any of these planes. If Phygius dies on any plane other than the Feywild, its body is destroyed but its essence travels back to the Feywild, and it is unable to take physical form or planeshift for a time.

_**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).**_ If Phygius fails a Saving Throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

_**Limited Magic Immunity.**_ Unless it wishes to be affected, Phygius is immune to spells of 5th level or lower. It has advantage on Saving Throws against all other spells and magical effects.

_**Magic Weapons.**_ Phygius' weapon attacks are magical.

_**Regeneration.**_ Phygius regains 20 Hit Points at the start of its turn. If it takes Necrotic damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of its next turn. Phygius dies only if it starts its turn with 0 Hit Points and doesn't regenerate.

#### Actions

_**Multiattack.**_ Phygius makes up to two attacks, one with its horns and one with its hooves.

_**Horns.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 40 (6d10 + 7) Piercing damage plus 18 (4d8) Force damage.

_**Hooves.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 34 (6d8 + 7) Bludgeoning damage plus 14 (4d6) Thunder damage, and if they are a creature, they must succeed on a DC 22 Strength Saving Throw or be knocked Prone.

#### Bonus Actions

_**Fear Gaze.**_ Phygius stares at a creature within 30 feet of it and fills their mind with fear. The creature must make a DC 24 Wisdom Saving Throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature is Frightened until the start of their next turn. If a creature's Saving Throw is successful, the creature is immune to Phygius' Fear Aura for the next 24 hours.

_**Teleport.**_ Phygius magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying and any number of creatures it targets within 30 feet, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. Unwilling creatures must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom Saving Throw or they are teleported along with Phygius.

#### Legendary Actions

Phygius can take 3 Legendary Actions, choosing from the options below. Only one Legendary Action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Phygius regains spent Legendary Actions at the start of its turn.

**Arcane Disruption.** Phygius casts _dispel magic_.

**Shift (Costs 2 Actions).** Phygius magically planeshifts, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying and any number of creatures it targets within 30 feet, to its corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane, the Feywild, or the Material Plane. Unwilling creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom Saving Throw or they are teleported along with Phygius. If a creature or object is present at the target location, they must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity Saving Throw or take 13 (3d8) Force damage and be knocked Prone. Whether the creature or object succeeds or fails on the save, they are pushed to an unoccupied space of Phygius' choice within 10 feet.

**Teleport.** Phygius uses its Teleport action.
