## October 1st (Challenge 0)

Prompt: **Trick-or-Treat**

### [Trickered Treat](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-monsters/blob/main/constructs/trickered-treat.md)

#### Lore

A creation of hags tired of Feywild children demanding sweets at all hours of the night, trickered treats are animated candies designed to look as inviting and appetizing as possible, so that they might tempt would-be victims into having a taste. Such temptations are short-lived, as the candies will immediately assail anyone interacting with them, taking careful aim at the creature's mouth and pummeling their teeth until they retreat. The treats are theoretically edible, but are coated with a putrefying concoction that will cause the most steel-hearted consumer's stomach to lurch violently.

_**Constructed Nature.**_ Trickered treats do not require air, food, drink, or sleep.

_**Sugar Rush.**_ Even though trickered treats are toxic to consume, they can still confer useful benefits to anyone who can stomach them. A Small or larger creature may swallow a grappled, restrained, or incapacitated trickered treat. Doing so instantly destroys the treat, and the creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is poisoned for 1 hour, and cannot regain hit points while poisoned in this manner. On a successful save, the creature gains the effects of the _haste_ spell for 1 minute (no concentration required).

_**False Appearance.**_ While the swarm remains motionless and isn't flying, it is indistinguishable from a normal pile of candy.

_**Swarm.**_ The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny creature. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

#### Actions

_**Cavities.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. _Hit:_ 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage, or 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. If the target is a creature that has teeth and was hit by this attack, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 2 (1d4) poison damage. The target has disadvantage on this saving throw if it has previously taken poison damage from a trickered treat in the last day.

## October 2nd (Challenge 1)

Prompt: **Capitalism**

### [Avatar of Debt](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-monsters/blob/main/undead/avatar-of-debt.md)

#### Lore

> 'Tis impossible to be sure of any thing but Death and Taxes.

â€” _The Cobbler of Preston_

On worlds where coinage and wealth dictate one's societal worth and position of power, taxes can be the great equalizer. Monarchs and paupers alike have fallen to the mighty tax collector, and so too do the mightiest adventurers eventually have to account for the mountains of wealth accrued during their escapades. For a very unlucky few, this rebalancing comes in the form of an audit from an avatar of debt.

Though the scythe of this grim spectre looks intimidating, it draws neither blood nor vitality. It instead cuts directly into the purse of whoever sits on the recieving end, reducing one's wealth with every blow. This taxman will not relent until one's entire balance is withdrawn, insisting that "the debt must be paid".

Any taxes the avatar collects are stowed away in a pocket dimension only it can access. If the avatar is reduced to 0 hit points, its pocket dimension collapses and its collected taxes appear on the ground where it previously stood.

##### Summoning an Avatar of Debt

The Dungeon Master may opt to replace the Ruin card from a _Deck of Many Things_ with the Audit card, which behaves as follows when drawn:

_**Audit.**_ You summon an avatar of debt â€“ a ghostly skeleton creature clad in a snappy business suit and burgundy tie, and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the Dungeon Master's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights you until you have no more wealth or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone besides you tries to attack the avatar, they summon their own avatar of debt. A creature whose wealth is reduced to 0 by an avatar of debt can't possess coinage for 3d10 days, during which time any coins it attempts to obtain disappear into the avatar's pocket dimension.

#### Attributes

_Medium undead, lawful evil_

- **Armor Class** 13
- **Hit Points** half the hit point maximum of its summoner
- **Speed** 60 ft., fly 60 ft. (hover)

|  STR  |  DEX  |  CON  |  INT  |  WIS  | CHA  |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:----:|
|14 (+2)|17 (+3)|16 (+3)|20 (+5)|18 (+4)|4 (-3)|

- **Damage Immunities** necrotic, poison
- **Condition Immunities** charmed, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, unconscious
- **Senses** darkvision 60 ft., truesight 60 ft., passive Perception 14
- **Languages** all languages known of its summoner
- **Challenge** equal to the summoner's level or challenge rating, minimum 1 (200 XP)[^ðŸ’€]

[^ðŸ’€]: Technically, the avatar of debt breaks D&D's challenge rating system; in addition to its scaling hit point maximum (similar to the avatar of death), the avatar cannot deal damage, and thus on its face presents no challenge beyond time spent. But the impact on wealth could be devastating to some players or campaigns, regardless of level. For the purpose of this project, we'll call the avatar a CR1, as a 1st level character should be able to defeat it, and in any case won't die even if the avatar wins the encounter.

#### Special Traits

_**Ledger Domain.**_ If the creature that summoned the avatar has no wealth in physical coinage, the avatar immediately teleports to its pocket dimension and cannot be summoned again by that creature for one year.

_**Desk Work.**_ The avatar is incapable of dealing damage to a creature.

_**Incorporeal Movement.**_ The avatar can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

_**Turning Immunity.**_ The avatar is immune to features that turn undead.

#### Actions

_**Taxes.**_ The avatar sweeps its spectral scythe through a creature within 5 feet of it. Roll a number of d12s equal to half the summoner's level or challenge rating (round down, minimum 1). A number of random coins equal to the dice roll immediately disappears from the target's wealth and reappears in the avatar's pocket dimension, and the avatar regains a number of hit points equal to the number of coins it takes.

The tax is collected even if the creature's wealth is not under its current physical possession; the coins will be removed from any chest, bank, loan to another creature, extradimensional space, or any other location or plane, as long as the wealth exists as physical coinage.

## October 3rd (Challenge 2)

Prompt: **Misunderstood Monster**

### [Werechimp](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-monsters/blob/main/humanoids/werechimp.md)

#### Lore

Perhaps the least studied of lycanthropes, troganthropes tend to form tight-knit bands far away from human settlements to avoid persecution. Their societies are often found in dense jungles or tropical islands to help maintain their distance from society, and their interactions with humans are rare, often limited to the occasional wandering explorer or unfortunate shipwreck.

Asinius Avitus Scipio, self-proclaimed first-hand expert on this subject, has published multiple volumes full of spurious assertions about werechimps. In _"Writing with One Arm: Tips for Limb-Lacking Mages and Interesting Applications of Mage Hand"_, he makes offhanded claims that werechimps have a prediliction toward severing and consuming the arms of humanoids they encounter, but the medical record has scant examples to offer in his support. By any reputable accounts, werechimps can be sociable people, though they prefer to keep to themselves. Most instances of troganthropic curses are accidental or provoked by human aggressors.

_**Characters as Werechimps.**_ The _Monster Manual_ has rules for characters afflicted with lycanthropy. The following text applies to werechimp characters specifically:

A character cursed with werechimp lycanthropy gains a Strength of 16 if their score isnâ€™t already higher. Attack and damage rolls for the werechimpâ€™s bite are based on whichever is higher of the characterâ€™s Strength and Dexterity.

#### Attributes

_Medium humanoid (any race, shapechanger)_

- **Armor Class** 12
- **Hit Points** 39 (6d8 + 12)
- **Speed** 30 ft. in humanoid form; 30 ft., climb 30 ft. in chimp and hybrid form

|  STR  |  DEX  |  CON  |  INT  |  WIS  |  CHA  |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
|16 (+3)|15 (+2)|15 (+2)|12 (+1)|15 (+2)|14 (+2)|

- **Skills** Athletics +5, Intimidation +4, Perception +4
- **Senses** passive Perception 14
- **Languages** Common (can't speak in chimp form)
- **Challenge** 2 (450 XP) **Proficiency Bonus** +2

#### Special Traits

_**Pack Tactics.**_ The werechimp has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the werechimp's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

#### Actions

_**Multiattack (Human or Hybrid Form Only).**_ The werechimp makes up to two attacks, only one of which can be a bite.

_**Bite (Chimp or Hybrid Form Only).**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with werechimp lycanthropy.

_**Fist.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage.

_**Stone Dagger.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 8 (2d4 + 3) piercing damage.

_**Change Shape.**_ The werechimp polymorphs into a chimpâ€“humanoid hybrid or into a chimp, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its speed, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isnâ€™t transformed. It reverts to its humanoid form if it dies.
